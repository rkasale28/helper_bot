# Helper Bot
#### Initiated and implemented a chatbot, integrated with webapp, which would provide a centralized platform for donors. This webapp was implemented using Flask Framework, whereas the chatbot was implemented using RASA Framework.

In August 2019, floods ravaged the districts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara. The main problem began after the floods. The essentials including clothes, utensils were flown away. The list even included school supplies.

For dealing with this, many helping hands came forward, from all over Maharashtra. These helping included sweepers to actors, children to senior citizens.

But, the problem was with communication. The information regarding collection centers and which commodities is required needed to be communicated to the donors. This communication was done either through news channels and the social media platforms. Therefore, there was no centralized platform as such.

Another problem was regarding uniformity. One commodity was recieved in a huge quantity, whereas another commodity was recieved in negligent quantity. For example, clothes and utensils were collected in large amounts, but on the other hand, there was a shortage of medicines and readymade food packets.

Therefore, decided to design a platform, which would act as bridge between donor and needy.

**Significance:**
- The chatbot will provide a centralized platform.
- The job of the collectors or mediators would ease.
- These mediators can update the requirements.
- The donors would easily get to know, the nearby center.
- Also, the donors would know what exactly is required.

**Frameworks Used:**
- Flask
- Rasa
